# SaveThePrincessVideoGame

This is a 2D video game leveraging the Processing library. The goal is to evade the enemies long enough for the princess to reach the halo. 

You can click the chests twice within each playthrough if you ever find yourself in a pinch and they will spawn devils that quickly path to and destroy the reapers.
Reapers who path onto the chest effected area begin to get confused and path randomly about until they get out.

The Dark Elf paths using the A* algorithm and, when in range, shoots a projdctile. Be careful out there!
